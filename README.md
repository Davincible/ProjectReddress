# ProjectReddress

This is an app I made for a 'sinterklaas suprise' it in dutch. Don't bother explaining further. Google it. ;)

Instructions are in the Package_One, and Package_Two dirs. Just like the Android apk.
The full experience of the app is not possible because it communicated with a microprocessor to do some fun stuff locally.
